        <h2>Story</h2>
        <h3>Season 1</h3>
        <p>
          At the start of the first season, crime in Gotham is in decline, but
          Gotham Chief of Police Angel Rojas orders his officers to hunt down
          Batman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bennett and Yin are tasked with capturing Batman. By the end of the
          season, Bennett is tortured and mutated by the Joker, transforming
          Bennett into Clayface. As Clayface, he is forced into hiding, while
          his partner Yin finally realizes she was wrong about Batman and forms
          an alliance with him.
        </p>
        <h3>Season 2</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the second season, Batman continues to act outside of the
          law even though he has Detective Yin as an ally. Batman begins making
          a name for himself as a force for good when he saves a group of
          policemen from certain doom. In this season, his heroic act prompts
          the officers to support him rather than pursue him as a criminal. In
          the season finale, Police Chief Rojas finally uncovers Yin's
          involvement with Batman, forcing her to go on the run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around this time, Commissioner James Gordon rejects Rojas' belief that
          Batman is a criminal. Commissioner Gordon instead believes Batman to
          be an ally of the Gotham police force and is particularly impressed
          when Batman and Yin capture the Joker, Penguin, and Riddler. He is
          revealed to be Batman's secret ally off-screen and develops a
          signaling searchlight, the Bat-Signal, allowing Batman to know that
          the police are firmly on his side.
        </p>
